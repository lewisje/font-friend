This is a bookmarklet made for web designers who want to rapidly check how different fonts and font styles look on their screen. Trying to develop good-looking font stacks is what prompted its creation, and I thought Iâ€™d share with the web design community.

See the [Project Page](http://somadesign.ca/projects/fontfriend/) for the bookmarklet (GCode doesn't like javscript:// links)
